# SNHU-CS300

## Introduction

The problem being addressed was to analize common data structures to find the best fit for storing Course and prerequisiste information, and to display that informtioan in a meaningful and efficient way.

The approach taken was to first understand the data and its structure. How the data elements were related and most importantly the shape of that data.
Next, three data structures were evaluated, the Vector, Hash Table, and a tree data structure. Each structure was evaluated using space and time complexity 
analysis to determine how efficient each data structure was in relation to space (memory) and run time.

Although the sample data set is quite small Big O time and space complexity analysis allows us to examine how that algorithm scales over time and memory space as the input (Courses) size grows.


$`O(1)`$  Constant Time
$`O(n)`$ Linear Time
$`O(n^2)`$   Quadratic Time
$`O(log n)`$   Logarithmic Time

$`\O(1)`$
$`\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2`$
$`\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2`$
$`\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2`$
