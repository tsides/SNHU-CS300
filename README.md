# SNHU-CS300



The problem being addressed was to analize common data structures to find the best fit for storing Course and prerequisiste information, and to display that informtioan in a meaningful and efficient way.

## Introduction

The approach taken was to first understand the data and its structure. How the data elements were related and most importantly the shape of that data.
Next, three data structures were evaluated, the Vector, Hash Table, and a tree data structure. Each structure was evaluated using space and time complexity 
analysis to determine how efficient the each data structure was in relation to space (memory) and runtime.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
