# SNHU-CS300

## Introduction

The problem being addressed was to analize common data structures to find the best fit for storing Course and prerequisiste information, and to display that informtioan in a meaningful and efficient way.

The approach taken was to first understand the data and its structure. How the data elements were related and most importantly the shape of that data.
Next, three data structures were evaluated, the Vector, Hash Table, and a tree data structure. Each structure was evaluated using space and time complexity 
analysis to determine how efficient each data structure was in relation to space (memory) and run time.

Although the sample data set is quite small Big O time and space complexity analysis allows us to examine how that algorithm scales over time and memory space as the input (Courses) size grows.
|  |  |  |
|--|--|--|
|$O(1)$  |Constant Time |Constant time is a category of function or algorithm where time / space complexity are constant. They do not grow as a function of the number of input or operands.|
|$O(n)$  |Linear Time|Linear time represents a function or algorithm where time / space complexity grows in a linear relationship to the number of input or operands.|
|$O(n^2)$  |Quadratic Time|Quadratic time represents a function or algorithm where time / space complexity grow as a function of the sqare of the number of inputs or operands.|
|$O(log n)$  |Logarithmic Time|Logarithmic time represents a function or algorthim where the size of the input is divided in half as the function or algorithm runs.|


The following graph shows each of these categories of Big O analysis.<br>

<br>
Blue represents quadratic time. Red is Constant Time, Black is logarithmic time, and purple is linear time. Note that logarithmic time will approach constant time as its input size is reduced. The goal of the
analysis is to find the algorthim and data structure that achieves as close to constant time as possible.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?<br>
I did not encounter any problems with this exercise.<br><br>

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?<br>
I found the Big O analysis process most insightful. I had not used this approach before.<br><br>

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?<br>
I don't know that the course has had any impact on this aspect of coding.
